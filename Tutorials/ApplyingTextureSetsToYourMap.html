<h3>Applying texture sets to your map</h3>
<p>Applying Texture Sets to your map is done using the <b>Brush</b> technique and the <b>Selection Block</b> technique.  For
information on how these work see the <a href=SelectionBlockvsBrushEditing.html>Selection block vs brush editing</a> tutorial.
The same principals apply to Texture Set assignment as they do to Cell insertion and removal.</p>
<p>The user must create Texture Sets before they can be applied to the map.  How to do this is covered in the
<a href=BasicMapCreation.html>Basic Map Creation</a> tutorial.</p>
<p>With some Texture Sets created, choose the <b>Texture Set</b> item from the <b>Edit Mode</b> droplist towards the top
of the <b>Cell Map Editor</b> window.</p>
<p>The Texture Set dialog bar will be shown docked to the right side of the <b>Cell Map Editor</b>.  It appears as follows when the <b>Current Brush</b>
is set to <b>Select</b>:</p>
<p><img src=TextureSetDialogBar.png /></p>
<p>The <b>Default Texture Set</b> droplist controls which Texture Set is used when you insert new cells into the map.  Changing the <b>Current Brush</b>
droplist item will cause the Texture Set dialog bar to change which controls appear inside it.  This will be covered below.</p>
<h4>Texture Set assignment via Selection Blocks</h4>
<p>With the <b>Current Brush</b> droplist set to <b>Select</b>, you may create a Selection Block in the map editor window that
encompasses one or more cells of your map.
Check the <a href=SelectionBlockvsBrushEditing.html>Selection block vs brush editing</a> tutorial if you're not sure how to do this.
Once created, click the <b>Set Texture Set</b> button and choose one of the Texture Sets.  Shown here is the before
and after of assigning a Texture Set named <i>Grass0</i> to a Selection Block:</p>

<h4>Texture Set assignment via Brushes</h4>
<p>To apply Texture Sets via the Brush technique change the <b>Current Brush</b> on the Texture Set dialog bar to <b>Apply</b>,
shown here:</p>
<p><img src=TextureSetDialogBarApply.png /></p>
<p>Choose any Texture Set from the list box, and <b>left click and drag</b> on cells in the map to apply the Texture Set.
You'll notice door cells and internal wall cells adopt the texture set you apply if you apply it to the cell next to them.
Door cells are considered to be Normal Doors, Secret Doors and Translucent doors.  Internal Wall cells are considered to
be Translucent Small Walls and Translucent Large Walls.</p>
<p>Shown next is a Texture Set named <i>Sand0</i> being applied to a map:</p>
<p><table border=1>
<tr><td><img src=TextureSetSand0Application0.png /></td><td>Left mouse button clicked and held.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src=TextureSetSand0Application1.png /></td><td>Mouse cursor dragged to the right and released.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src=TextureSetSand0Application2.png /></td><td>The rest of the non-liquid part of the room is painted.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src=TextureSetSand0Application3.png /></td><td>Zoomed out and painted all of the liquid part of the room.</td></tr>
