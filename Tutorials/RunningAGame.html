<h3>Running A Game</h3>
<p>SageEngine requires a command line argument.  This argument is the relative path to a game file that was
saved from SageStudio.  This relative path must point to a file in the <b>Games</b> subdirectory in your Content
Directory.  Note that game files saved by SageStudio have a "ssg" file extension.  The easiest way to create this
command line argument is via an Explorer shortcut at the root of your Content Directory.</p>
<p>After having saved my PengiuShooter game and exited SageStudio, my Content Directory looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=ExplorerAfterSave.png /></p>
<p>So to create my Explorer shortcut I drag SageEngine.exe with the <b>right mouse button</b> to an empty part of
the Explorer window, and release the right mouse button.  Explorer displays the following popup menu:</p>
<p><img src=CreateExplorerShortcut.png /></p>
<p>I choose <b>Create Shortcuts Here</b> to create the shortcut.  Next I <b>right click</b> on the new shortcut
and choose <b>Rename</b>, and type in <b>Run PenguinShooter</b>, and press <b>Enter</b>.  I then <b>right click</b> on
my PenguinShooter shortcut and choose <b>Properties</b>.  In the <b>Target</b> editbox, I <b>add to the end of the text</b>
the relative path to my PenguinShooter game, which is <b>Games\PenguinShooter.ssg</b>.  The dialog should look like this:</p>
<p><img src=ShortcutProperties.png /></p>
<p>Click OK to accept the changes.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If your game's name has a space in it, such as if I had called my game
"Penguin Shooter", instead of "PenguinShooter", then I would have needed to put quotes around the relative path, that is, I
would have had to add the text <b>"Games\Penguin Shooter.ssg"</b>, including the quotes, to the Target edit box within the dialog.</p>
<p>That's it.  To run Penguin Shooter, double click the <b>Run PenguinShooter</b> shortcut!</p>
<h4>Default Key and Mouse Bindings</h4>
<p>You can change these in SageStudio by clicking on <b>Default Bindings</b> in <b>Game Manager</b></p>
