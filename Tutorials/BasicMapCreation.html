<h3>Basic Map Creation</h3>
<p>To create a map right click on <b>Cell Map</b> and click <b>Insert</b>.  Call your
map whatever you like, I called mine <i>Level0</i>.  Once you click OK from the dialog a map with the name you entered
will be inserted into the tree and selected.  This causes the main view to change to the <b>Cell Map Editor</b>, shown here:</p>
<p><img src="CellMapEditor.png"></p>
<p>We'll create our map using the <b>Brush</b> technique.  Change the <b>Current Brush</b> drop list on the right hand side
dialog bar to <b>Normal</b>.  Now drag the mouse cursor in the main 3D view to place cells of type <b>Normal.</b>  Here's
what I created:</p>
<p><img src="NoTexSet.png"></p>
<p>You'll immediately notice that a checkerboard Texture was applied to your cells.  This happened because no Texture
Sets exist yet, so SageStudio used the Default Texture.  Let's create a Texture Set and apply it to our cells.  Before we
can do that however, we must create a <b>Resource Context</b>, because this is the container that holds the Textures used
by a Texture Set.</p>
<p>From the Game Manager, right click on <b>Resource Contexts</b> and click <b>Insert</b>.  Call your Resource Context <i>Main</i>
and press <b>Enter</b>.</p>
<p>Now right click on <b>Texture Sets</b> in Game Manager and click <b>Insert</b>.  Type <b>Rock0</b> for the name.  You'll
notice that your Resource Context is selected in the droplist.  This is because it's the only one you have at the moment.
Press <b>Enter</b> to accept the dialog.  The <b>Texture Set Editor</b> is displayed in the main view.</p>
<p><img src="TextureSetEditor.png"></p>
<p>This editor will allow you to assign a Texture to each <i>type</i> of polygon that SageStudio will create for your cells.
Double click the listbox item named <b>Wall</b> to open the <b>Choose Texture</b> dialog, shown here:</p>
<p><img src="ChooseTextureDialog.png"></p>
<p>This dialog lists all the Textures from your Content Directory's subdirectory named Textures.  Double click any Texture
to assign that Texture to the <b>Wall</b> polygon type.  Double click every other polygon type and assign Textures.  Your
Texture Set should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="AllTexturesAssigned.png"></p>
<p>From the Game Manager, left click on your Resource Context named <b>Main</b>.  It should look something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="ResourceContextFilledIn.png"></p>
<p>You'll notice that some Textures have been added to your Resource Context.  When you assigned Textures in your Texture Set,
SageStudio automatically placed them into your Resource Context for you.  Now left click your map named <b>Level0</b> from the
Game Manager.  We'll now use our newly created Texture Set to paint our map cells.</p>
<p>Change the <b>Edit Mode</b> droplist at the top of the main view to <b>Texture Set</b>.  Change the <b>Current Brush</b>
droplist to <b>Apply</b>.  Select your Texture Set named <b>Rock0</b> from the list.  You may now drag the mouse cursor
over the cells in your world to apply <i>Rock0</i> to them.  You should have something like this:</p>
<p><img src="PaintedCells.png"></p>
<p>Let's save the game now.  Choose <b>Save</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, or press <b>Ctrl+S</b>.</p>
<p><strong><i>It is very important to save your game in the Games subdirectory</i></strong>, shown here:</p>
<p><img src="SaveDialog.png"></p>
<p>You'll notice that SageStudio filled in the name of the file for you, which is <i>PenguinShooter</i> in my case, so just
hit <b>Enter</b> to save the file.  SageStudio updates the title bar of the main window to reflect your game's filename.</p>

<p>That's your basic map done.  In order for SageEngine to run your map, you need to create a State Machine that tells 
SageEngine what to do.  Specifically, you need to tell SageEngine to run a map, and tell it which map that is.  This is pretty
easy to do, read about it in <a href="CreatingAStateMachineToControlSageEngine.html">Creating a State Machine to Control SageEngine</a></p>
