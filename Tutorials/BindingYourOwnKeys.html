<h3>Binding Your Own Keys</h3>
<p>To run the Default Bindings Editor <b>left click</b> on the <b>Default Bindings</b> tree item in <b>Game Manager</b>.</p>
<p><img src=DefaultBindings.png /></p>
<p>To add or edit a binding simply double click it.  This displays the <b>Choose Bind Command</b> dialog box.</p>
<p><img src=ChooseBindCommand.png /></p>
<p>Double clicking a Bind Command from this dialog sets the binding in Default Bindings Editor.  For example, to set the
key W as the <i>Move Camera Forward</i> command, you would double click the <b>KEY_W</b> item, then double click <b>Camera.Move.Forward</b>
binding.  The main view would now appear as follows:</p>

<p>That's pretty much it for setting bindings.  An exception is the <b>Camera.Current.Set</b> command which requires you
to identify a Camera to set.  For example, if you had 3 cameras in your game named, say, Cam0, Cam1 and Cam2, you could
make the keys F1, F2 and F3 set them as the current camera each time you pressed these keys on your keyboard.  You would
do as follows to achieve this:</p>
<p>Double click the item <b>KEY_F1</b>, this opens the <b>Choose Bind Command</b> dialog box, double click the item
<b>Camera.Current.Set</b>, this displays the following <b>Choose Camera</b> dialog:</p>
<p><img src=ChooseCamera.png /></p>
<p>Double click the <b>Cam0</b> item (obviously you would have to add the 3 cameras prior to setting this binding).  You'd
repeat this process for bindings to the keys F2 and F3 to cameras Cam1 and Cam2 respectively.  After this is done, your main
view would appear as follows:</p>
